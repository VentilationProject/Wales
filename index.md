# Purpose of site

To lower the transmission of COVID-19 another airborne diseases in schools. [..](See the longer rationale that's pertient to all countries on the home page). For Wales, though, we have 1,460 schools with unknown ventilation and air filtration. We don't know what their policy is today, but all enacted the statistically less relevant "wipe surfaces" and wash hands advice that the WHO incorrectly gave the world at the start of the pandemic.

As well as the reading materials linked to on the home page for why we should ventilate schools that have a global perspective, we have some UK centric reading materials, too:

* UK's National Education Union on [ventilation in schools](https://neu.org.uk/advice/health-and-safety/workplace-conditions/ventilation-schools-and-colleges).
* UK GOV [How schools are managing ventilation to prevent the spread of airborne viruses like Covid-19](https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2022/06/30/how-schools-are-managing-ventilation-to-prevent-the-spread-of-airborne-viruses-like-covid-19/).
* UK company Ventive with a good [Guide to school ventilation system design:
Mitigating virus spread and supporting long-term occupant health and comfort](https://ventive.co.uk/resources/ventilation-guide-for-schools-best-practice-in-a-post-covid-world/).
