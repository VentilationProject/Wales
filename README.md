The data for the Schools is from https://github.com/openregister/school-wls-data/blob/master/lists/180410-address-list-schools-wales-ency.ods which is also under MIT license. That ODS file was passed to GTP4 for turning into CSV (which, as an action, would not change the MIT license)

People making changes to markdown should consider that they're also doing so under a MIT license.
